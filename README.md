## My process
  I wrote mobile first and then use media queries for responsive web desing. For the JS i use fetch to extract the API

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
### What I learned

ItÂ´s my first time using fetch to get and API information. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```js
let getInfo = async()=>{
    let idRequest = await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice')
    let idResult = await idRequest.json()
    let HTMLCodeID = `ADVICE #${idResult.slip.id}`
    let HTMLCodeText = `"${idResult.slip.advice}"`
    document.querySelector('.box__element--id').textContent = HTMLCodeID
    document.querySelector('.box__element--text').textContent = HTMLCodeText
}

getInfo();

// Listener to get new advice
let reroll = document.getElementById('box__element--button')
reroll.addEventListener('click', () =>{
    getInfo()
})
```
### Continued development

I need to learn more about animations in CSS
